# Testing Improvements & TODO List

Based on the comprehensive test suite review, here's a prioritized list of improvements and enhancements to further strengthen our testing strategy.

## üî• High Priority (Immediate - Next Sprint)

### 1. Standardize Async Testing Patterns
**Issue**: Mixed usage of `fireEvent` with `act()` vs `userEvent` in Settings tests
**Impact**: Inconsistent test patterns, potential flaky tests
**Action Items**:
- [ ] Refactor Settings.test.jsx to use `userEvent` consistently
- [ ] Create testing guidelines document for async interactions
- [ ] Update other test files to follow consistent patterns

**Example**:
```javascript
// Replace this:
act(() => {
  fireEvent.change(input, { target: { value: 'new value' } })
})

// With this:
await user.type(input, 'new value')
```

### 2. Extract Common Test Data to Fixtures
**Issue**: Repeated mock data across test files
**Impact**: Maintenance overhead, inconsistent test data
**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create `frontend/tests/__fixtures__/` directory
- [ ] Extract common mock data:
  - [ ] `mockFeedbackItems.js`
  - [ ] `mockUserData.js`
  - [ ] `mockApiResponses.js`
- [ ] Update existing tests to use fixtures

### 3. Create Custom Render Utilities
**Issue**: Repeated setup code in tests
**Impact**: Test boilerplate, maintenance overhead
**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create `frontend/tests/utils/test-utils.js`
- [ ] Implement custom render functions:
  - [ ] `renderWithRouter(component, options)`
  - [ ] `renderWithAuth(component, mockUser)`
  - [ ] `renderWithQueryClient(component)`
- [ ] Update tests to use custom utilities

## üî∂ Medium Priority (Next 2-3 Sprints)

### 4. Add Performance Testing
**Issue**: No performance validation for data-heavy components
**Impact**: Potential performance regressions undetected
**Action Items**:
- [ ] Add performance tests for FeedbackItem with large datasets
- [ ] Test FeedbackSummary with high numbers of feedback items
- [ ] Add memory leak detection for components with heavy re-renders
- [ ] Consider using `@testing-library/react-hooks` for custom hook performance

### 5. Implement Snapshot Testing
**Issue**: Complex layouts not protected against visual regressions
**Impact**: Unintended UI changes could slip through
**Action Items**:
- [ ] Add snapshot tests for Settings page layout
- [ ] Add snapshot tests for NotFound page
- [ ] Add snapshot tests for FeedbackSummary chart rendering
- [ ] Set up snapshot update workflow in CI/CD

### 6. Enhance Error Boundary Testing
**Issue**: Limited testing of error scenarios
**Impact**: Error handling edge cases not covered
**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create ErrorBoundary test wrapper
- [ ] Test components that make API calls under error conditions
- [ ] Add tests for network failure scenarios
- [ ] Test component behavior when props are unexpectedly undefined

### 7. Add Integration Testing
**Issue**: Components tested in isolation may miss integration issues
**Impact**: Interface contracts between components not validated
**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create integration tests for Dashboard ‚Üí FeedbackSummary flow
- [ ] Test Settings ‚Üí API ‚Üí State update flow
- [ ] Add tests for RecentFeedback ‚Üí FeedbackItem interaction
- [ ] Test router navigation flows

## üî∑ Low Priority (Future Enhancements)

### 8. Visual Regression Testing
**Issue**: No automated visual testing
**Impact**: UI changes require manual verification
**Action Items**:
- [ ] Evaluate tools (Chromatic, Percy, or Playwright)
- [ ] Set up visual regression testing pipeline
- [ ] Create baseline screenshots for key components
- [ ] Integrate with CI/CD for automated visual checks

### 9. Accessibility Testing Enhancement
**Issue**: Basic accessibility testing, could be more comprehensive
**Impact**: Accessibility issues might not be caught
**Action Items**:
- [ ] Add `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers for accessibility
- [ ] Implement axe-core testing with `@axe-core/react`
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation flow tests
- [ ] Test screen reader compatibility

### 10. Test Performance Optimization
**Issue**: Large test suite (1,411 lines) might become slow
**Impact**: Slower development feedback loop
**Action Items**:
- [ ] Profile test execution times
- [ ] Identify and optimize slow tests
- [ ] Consider test parallelization
- [ ] Evaluate test splitting strategies

### 11. Mock Service Worker (MSW) Integration
**Issue**: API mocking could be more realistic
**Impact**: API integration issues might not surface in tests
**Action Items**:
- [ ] Set up MSW for more realistic API mocking
- [ ] Create shared API handlers for tests
- [ ] Replace simple mocks with MSW handlers
- [ ] Add network delay simulation for loading state tests

## üìã Documentation & Process

### 12. Testing Guidelines Documentation
**Priority**: Medium
**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create `TESTING_GUIDELINES.md`
- [ ] Document testing patterns and conventions
- [ ] Add examples of good vs bad test practices
- [ ] Include mock strategies and when to use each

### 13. Test Coverage Goals
**Priority**: Low
**Action Items**:
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting
- [ ] Define coverage thresholds (e.g., 80% line coverage)
- [ ] Add coverage checks to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create coverage badges for README

## üéØ Success Metrics

Track progress with these metrics:
- [ ] Test execution time (target: <30 seconds for full suite)
- [ ] Test coverage percentage (target: >85%)
- [ ] Number of flaky tests (target: 0)
- [ ] Time to write new tests (should decrease with better utilities)

## üìù Notes

### Current Test Suite Strengths
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Good component isolation
- Proper mock usage
- Strong accessibility considerations
- Well-organized test structure

### Areas of Excellence to Maintain
- Descriptive test names
- Proper cleanup in `beforeEach`
- Good assertion quality
- Edge case handling

### Implementation Tips
1. **Start Small**: Begin with high-priority items that provide immediate value
2. **Incremental**: Don't refactor all tests at once; update as you touch files
3. **Team Consensus**: Discuss testing patterns with the team before implementing
4. **Documentation**: Update guidelines as patterns evolve
