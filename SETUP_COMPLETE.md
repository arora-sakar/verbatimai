# SMB Feedback Insights Project Setup Complete

## What's Been Accomplished

We have successfully initialized both the frontend and backend repositories for the SMB Feedback Insights MVP project as outlined in the roadmap document. Here's a summary of what's been completed:

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

- Set up the basic project structure with all necessary directories
- Created database models for users and feedback items
- Implemented authentication system with JWT tokens
- Built API routes for users, feedback, and analytics
- Implemented CSV upload and processing
- Added AI-powered sentiment analysis and topic extraction (with local fallback)
- Set up database connection with SQLAlchemy
- Added Alembic for database migrations
- Created Docker configuration for easy deployment

### Frontend (React/Vite)

- Set up the project with Vite, React Router, and Tailwind CSS
- Implemented authentication with login and registration
- Created dashboard page with analytics visualizations
- Built feedback list with filtering and search
- Added CSV upload functionality
- Implemented single feedback entry form
- Created settings page for account management
- Set up responsive layout with mobile support
- Added Docker configuration

### DevOps

- Added Docker and docker-compose configurations for both services
- Created comprehensive README files
- Added license and gitignore
- Configured the project for easy local development

## Next Steps

To complete the Sprint 0 setup as per the roadmap:

1. **Initialize the database:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **Start the application:**
   - Using Docker:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
   - Or manually:
     ```bash
     # Terminal 1
     cd backend
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     python run.py
     
     # Terminal 2
     cd frontend
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```

3. **Create test users and data:**
   - Register a user through the frontend
   - Upload some sample feedback data

4. **Begin Sprint 1 implementation:**
   - Focus on polishing the core authentication
   - Improve CSV upload and validation
   - Enhance basic feedback storage and retrieval

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend
2. **CI/CD**: Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines
3. **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring for production
4. **Documentation**: Expand API documentation and user guides
5. **Security**: Perform security audit and implement best practices

The project is now ready for development. You can access the frontend at http://localhost:3000 and the backend API at http://localhost:8000.
