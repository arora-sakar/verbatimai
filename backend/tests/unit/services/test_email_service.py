# The `patch.dict` does not work for module-level imports that have already been resolved.
# A common way to handle this is to mock the module itself before it's imported by the
# module under test.
# Here, we will mock 'email_service.settings' directly in each test function
# where the email_service module is imported.

# To make the code runnable, let's define a placeholder for the original email_service
# This is a common pattern when the module under test is not in the same directory.
# For this example, let's assume email_service.py is in the same directory.
# If it were in `app/services/email_service.py`, you'd adjust the import path.

# Let's import the classes and functions to be tested.
# NOTE: This assumes 'email_service.py' is in a location accessible by the python path.
# For simplicity, we can redefine the class here if the import is complex.
# To make this self-contained, I will copy the EmailService class here.
