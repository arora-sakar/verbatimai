```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

5. Edit the `.env` file to set up your database connection and API keys.

6. Initialize the database:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

7. Run the server:

```bash
python run.py

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The frontend application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive testing framework covering both backend and frontend:

### Running Tests

```bash
# Setup testing framework (first time only)
chmod +x setup_testing.sh
